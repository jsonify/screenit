- Universal binary generation (Intel + Apple Silicon architectures)
- Build artifact creation and structure verification

### Integration Tests

**CI/CD Pipeline End-to-End**
- Complete workflow execution from code push to artifact creation
- Pull request validation with status check reporting
- Release workflow triggering and GitHub release creation

**Code Signing and Notarization**
- Certificate installation and keychain configuration
- Signing process validation with codesign verification
- Notarization submission and status polling

**Artifact Distribution**
