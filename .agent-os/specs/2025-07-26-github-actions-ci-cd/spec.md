# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: GitHub Actions CI/CD with Native xcodebuild
> Created: 2025-07-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline using native xcodebuild commands to replace fastlane dependency, providing automated build, test, and distribution workflows for the screenit macOS application.

## User Stories

### Development Team Workflow

As a developer, I want automated CI/CD triggered on pull requests and main branch pushes, so that code quality is maintained and releases are automated without manual intervention.

The workflow will automatically build the project, run unit tests, perform static analysis, and create distributable archives when code is pushed. This ensures consistent build quality and reduces manual deployment overhead while providing immediate feedback on code changes.

### Release Management

As a maintainer, I want automated release builds with proper code signing and notarization, so that users can download signed applications without security warnings.

The system will handle Developer ID signing, notarization with Apple's notary service, and create GitHub releases with downloadable .dmg files for distribution to end users.

## Spec Scope

1. **GitHub Actions Workflow Configuration** - Complete CI/CD pipeline with build, test, and release stages
2. **Native xcodebuild Integration** - Replace fastlane with direct xcodebuild commands for all build operations
3. **Automated Testing Pipeline** - Unit test execution with coverage reporting and failure notifications
4. **Code Signing and Notarization** - Developer ID signing with Apple notarization for distribution builds
5. **Artifact Management** - Build artifact storage, release asset creation, and download distribution

## Out of Scope

- App Store Connect integration (focus on direct distribution)
- Legacy fastlane configuration maintenance
- Custom build scripts beyond xcodebuild capabilities
- Third-party CI/CD platforms (focus on GitHub Actions only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional GitHub Actions workflow that builds, tests, and creates signed release artifacts
2. Automated pull request validation with build status checks and test results
3. Signed and notarized .app bundles ready for distribution outside the App Store
