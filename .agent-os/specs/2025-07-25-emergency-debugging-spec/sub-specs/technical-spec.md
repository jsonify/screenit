# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-07-25-emergency-debugging-spec/spec.md

> Created: 2025-07-25
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Debug Logging Infrastructure
- Add comprehensive logging to MenuBarManager.saveImageToDesktop() function with entry/exit markers
- Implement verbose logging for Desktop directory resolution process
- Add detailed CGImageDestination creation and finalization logging
- Include file system state verification after save operations
- Log all error conditions with specific error details and context

### File System Validation
- Verify Desktop directory URL resolution with FileManager.default.url() logging
- Check Desktop directory existence and write permissions before save attempt
- Implement post-save file existence verification using FileManager.fileExists()
- Add file size and metadata validation after successful save
- Log complete file path and permissions for debugging

### Permission and Security Debugging
- Audit macOS file system permissions for Desktop directory access
- Check app entitlements and sandboxing restrictions affecting file saves
- Verify user has write permissions to Desktop directory
- Add logging for any security or permission-related errors

### Error Detection and Reporting
- Implement detailed error handling for all CGImageDestination operations
- Add specific error messages for common failure scenarios
- Include timestamp and execution context in all debug messages
- Create structured logging format for easy analysis

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Minimal Debug Logging (Selected)
- Add debug statements to existing saveImageToDesktop function
- Use Swift print() statements for immediate Console.app visibility
- Focus on critical failure points: directory access, file creation, finalization
- Pros: Quick to implement, immediate visibility, minimal code changes
- Cons: Basic logging only, no structured output

**Option B:** Comprehensive Logging Framework
- Implement full OSLog structured logging throughout image save pipeline
- Create dedicated debug logging class with multiple verbosity levels
- Add performance metrics and detailed state tracking
- Pros: Professional logging, structured data, performance insights
- Cons: More complex implementation, may mask timing issues

**Rationale:** Option A selected for immediate emergency debugging needs. Can be enhanced to Option B later if needed.

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies required - uses built-in Swift logging and macOS APIs only.

**Justification:** Emergency debugging should rely only on system frameworks to avoid introducing new variables or potential issues.
