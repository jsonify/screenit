# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Preferences Window Redesign
> Created: 2025-07-29
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Redesign the preferences window interface to match the screen capture mocks provided, transforming from a segmented tab-based design to a modern sidebar-based preferences window with dedicated sections for General, Screenshots, Annotate, Quick Access, and Advanced settings.

## User Stories

### Modern Preferences Interface

As a user, I want a modern, sidebar-based preferences window that follows macOS design conventions, so that I can easily navigate between different preference categories and quickly find the settings I need.

The preferences window should feature a left sidebar with icon-based navigation tabs (General, Wallpaper, Shortcuts, Quick Access, Recording, Screenshots, Annotate, Cloud, Advanced, About) and a main content area that displays the relevant settings for each section. The interface should be clean, organized, and intuitive to use.

### Enhanced Settings Organization

As a user, I want settings to be logically organized into clear categories with appropriate visual hierarchy, so that I can efficiently configure the application without confusion about where specific options are located.

Settings should be grouped with clear labels, proper spacing, and appropriate controls (toggles, dropdowns, sliders, etc.) that match the functionality shown in the design mocks.

### Comprehensive Preference Coverage

As a user, I want access to all preference categories shown in the mocks including new sections like Quick Access and enhanced organization of existing settings, so that I have complete control over the application's behavior.

The redesigned preferences should maintain all existing functionality while adding new organizational structure and potentially new features as shown in the mock designs.

## Spec Scope

1. **Sidebar Navigation System** - Implement icon-based sidebar with proper navigation and selection states
2. **General Preferences Panel** - Redesign with startup options, sounds, menu bar settings, export location, and post-capture actions
3. **Screenshots Preferences Panel** - Implement file format, retina scaling, color management, frame options, background settings, and capture modes  
4. **Annotate Preferences Panel** - Reorganize annotation tool settings with arrow, pencil, background tool, shadow, canvas, accessibility, and window options
5. **Quick Access Preferences Panel** - Create new panel for overlay positioning, multi-display settings, auto-close behavior, drag & drop, and save button configuration
6. **Advanced Preferences Panel** - Implement file naming, clipboard options, pinned screenshots, history management, All-In-One features, text recognition, and API controls

## Out of Scope

- Wallpaper, Recording, Cloud, and About sections (shown in sidebar but not implemented in current mocks)
- Backend functionality changes for settings not currently supported
- Import/export settings functionality (marked as disabled in current implementation)
- New capture modes or annotation tools beyond preference configuration

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Modern Preferences Window** - Fully functional sidebar-based preferences interface matching the provided mocks
2. **All Preference Panels Implemented** - Working General, Screenshots, Annotate, Quick Access, and Advanced panels with proper data binding
3. **Settings Persistence** - All new and reorganized settings properly saved to Core Data and loaded on app restart
