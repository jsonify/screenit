# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-01-27-polished-hotkey-interface-spec/spec.md

> Created: 2025-01-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture Integration

- **SwiftUI Framework Compatibility**: All components must be built using SwiftUI 5.0+ with macOS 15+ target compatibility
- **PreferencesManager Integration**: Seamless integration with existing PreferencesManager.shared singleton without API changes
- **GlobalHotkeyManager Compatibility**: Full compatibility with existing GlobalHotkeyManager hotkey registration system
- **HotkeyParser Integration**: Utilize existing HotkeyParser validation and formatting without modifications
- **Core Data Persistence**: Maintain existing UserPreferences Core Data model integration

### Performance Requirements

- **Recording Response Time**: Hotkey recording must capture key events within 50ms of user input
- **UI Responsiveness**: All UI state changes must complete within 16ms for 60fps performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Modal interface memory footprint should not exceed 10MB during active use
- **Event Processing**: Global event monitoring must not impact system performance measurably

### Accessibility Requirements

- **VoiceOver Compatibility**: Full screen reader support with descriptive labels and state announcements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete keyboard navigation support using Tab, Space, Enter, and Escape keys
- **High Contrast Support**: Interface must remain functional and readable in high contrast mode
- **Dynamic Type Support**: Text elements must scale appropriately with system font size preferences

## Approach Options

### Option A: Enhanced Current Implementation (Recommended)

**Description**: Improve the existing HotkeyCustomizationView with visual refinements, better recording functionality, and enhanced user experience while maintaining the current architectural approach.

**Pros**:
- Minimal risk to existing functionality
- Leverages proven architecture patterns
- Maintains backwards compatibility
- Fastest implementation timeline

**Cons**:
- Limited by existing architectural constraints
- May not achieve maximum visual polish potential

### Option B: Complete Redesign with New Architecture

**Description**: Create entirely new hotkey customization components with modern SwiftUI patterns, improved state management, and advanced visual design.

**Pros**:
- Maximum design flexibility and polish potential
- Opportunity to implement latest SwiftUI best practices
- Clean architectural foundation for future enhancements

**Cons**:
- Higher development risk and complexity
- Potential compatibility issues with existing systems
- Longer implementation timeline

**Rationale**: Option A is selected because it provides the best balance of improvement potential and implementation risk, allowing us to achieve the desired polish while maintaining system stability.

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required. The implementation will utilize existing system frameworks:

- **SwiftUI**: Primary UI framework for interface components
- **Carbon**: For global event monitoring during hotkey recording (existing usage)
- **Core Data**: For preferences persistence (existing integration)
- **AppKit**: For system integration and window management (existing usage)

**Justification**: Maintaining zero new dependencies aligns with the project's minimal dependency strategy while ensuring maximum compatibility and security.

## Implementation Architecture

### Component Structure

```
HotkeyCustomizationView (Enhanced)
├── HotkeyDisplayComponent (New)
│   ├── Modern visual design with SF Symbols
│   ├── Animated state transitions
│   └── Accessibility integration
├── HotkeyRecordingModal (Enhanced)
│   ├── VisualRecordingArea (New)
│   ├── RecordingStatusIndicator (New)
│   └── ValidationFeedbackComponent (New)
└── HotkeyValidationService (Enhanced)
    ├── Real-time validation
    ├── Enhanced error messaging
    └── Conflict detection
```

### State Management

- **@StateObject HotkeyRecorder**: Enhanced with better event handling and cleanup
- **@State UI States**: Separate states for recording, validation, and modal presentation
- **@EnvironmentObject PreferencesManager**: Maintain existing integration pattern
- **Combine Publishers**: For debounced validation and reactive UI updates

### Event Handling Architecture

```swift
// Enhanced event handling with proper cleanup
class EnhancedHotkeyRecorder: ObservableObject {
    @Published var recordingState: RecordingState
    @Published var capturedHotkey: String?
    @Published var visualFeedback: VisualFeedback
    
    private var eventMonitor: GlobalEventMonitor
    private var feedbackGenerator: HapticFeedbackGenerator
}
```

### Visual Design System

- **SF Symbols Integration**: Use system symbols for consistent iconography
- **macOS Design Tokens**: Align with system colors, spacing, and typography
- **Animation Framework**: Subtle micro-interactions using SwiftUI animations
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus handling for keyboard navigation

## Data Flow Architecture

```
User Interaction → HotkeyDisplayComponent → HotkeyRecordingModal → 
EnhancedHotkeyRecorder → ValidationService → PreferencesManager → 
GlobalHotkeyManager → System Registration
```

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Graceful Degradation**: Non-critical features fail without affecting core functionality
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages with actionable recovery suggestions  
- **Logging Integration**: Comprehensive logging using existing OSLog framework
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for transient failures

## Security Considerations

- **Event Monitor Permissions**: Proper handling of accessibility permission requirements
- **Memory Management**: Prevent memory leaks in global event monitoring
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user input before processing
- **Permission Checks**: Validate accessibility permissions before attempting recording

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Component logic and state management validation
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end hotkey registration and preferences integration
- **Accessibility Tests**: VoiceOver and keyboard navigation validation
- **Performance Tests**: Memory usage and responsiveness under load
- **Manual Testing**: Visual design and user experience validation
