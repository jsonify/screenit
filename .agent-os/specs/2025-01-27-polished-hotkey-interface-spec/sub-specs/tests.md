## Test Data Sets

### Valid Hotkey Combinations
```swift
let validHotkeys = [
    "cmd+shift+4",
    "ctrl+shift+s", 
    "cmd+f6",
    "option+shift+3",
    "cmd+shift+a"
]
```

let invalidHotkeys = [
    "",
    "invalid+key",
    "cmd",
    "shift+",
    "cmd+unknown+key"
]
```

```swift
let systemConflicts = [
    "cmd+space",      // Spotlight
    "cmd+tab",        // App switcher
    "cmd+q",          // Quit
    "ctrl+up"         // Mission Control
]
```

### Edge Case Inputs
```swift
let edgeCases = [
    "CMD+SHIFT+4",           // Uppercase
    " cmd + shift + 4 ",     // Extra spaces
