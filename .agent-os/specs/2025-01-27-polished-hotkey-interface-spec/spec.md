> Spec: Polished Hotkey Customization Interface
> Created: 2025-01-27
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a polished, modern hotkey customization interface that matches the design quality of contemporary macOS applications, replacing the current basic implementation with a visually consistent, fully functional hotkey recording system that integrates seamlessly with the existing preferences architecture.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story: Professional Hotkey Configuration

As a macOS power user, I want to customize my screenshot hotkey with a polished, intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently configure shortcuts that match my workflow without encountering visual inconsistencies or non-functional recording features.

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. User opens Preferences and navigates to Capture tab
2. User sees current hotkey displayed in a modern, polished button/field
3. User clicks "Customize..." to open a refined modal interface
4. User can choose between three methods: live recording, text input, or preset selection
5. Live recording provides immediate visual feedback with proper key combination capture
6. Interface validates hotkeys in real-time with clear status indicators
7. User applies changes with confirmation and immediate system registration

### Secondary User Story: Visual Consistency

As a design-conscious user, I want the hotkey customization interface to match the visual quality and consistency of the rest of the preferences system, so that the application feels professionally designed and cohesive.

**Problem Solved:** Eliminates visual inconsistencies between hotkey interface and other preference components, ensuring unified design language throughout the application.

## Spec Scope

1. **Modernized Visual Design** - Redesign hotkey display and customization components with contemporary macOS design patterns
2. **Functional Recording System** - Implement reliable live hotkey recording with proper event handling and user feedback
3. **Enhanced Validation UI** - Improve validation feedback with clear status indicators and helpful error messages
4. **Accessibility Improvements** - Ensure VoiceOver compatibility and keyboard navigation support
5. **Animation and Polish** - Add subtle animations and micro-interactions for professional feel

## Out of Scope

- Changes to underlying hotkey registration system (GlobalHotkeyManager)
- Modifications to hotkey parsing logic (HotkeyParser)
- Multi-hotkey support (single hotkey customization only)
- Hotkey conflict resolution with third-party applications

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Visually Polished Hotkey Display** - Modern button-style hotkey display in preferences that matches system design patterns
2. **Functional Recording Interface** - Reliable live recording with immediate visual feedback and proper event handling
3. **Comprehensive Validation UI** - Real-time validation with clear success/warning/error states and helpful messaging
4. **Seamless Integration** - Perfect integration with existing PreferencesManager and GlobalHotkeyManager systems with no breaking changes
