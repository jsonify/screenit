### Feature Tests

**End-to-End Annotation Workflow**
- User captures screenshot using existing capture engine
- Enters annotation mode with captured image displayed
- Selects arrow tool and draws arrow with custom color
- Adds text annotation with custom font size
- Draws rectangle with specified stroke thickness
- Applies highlight effect to selected area
- Uses blur tool to obscure sensitive information
- Performs multiple undo operations to verify history
- Re-applies changes using redo functionality
- Exports final annotated image to clipboard or file

**Tool Interaction Scenarios**
- Switch between all annotation tools without losing existing annotations
- Modify tool properties (color, thickness, font size) and apply to new annotations
- Create overlapping annotations with proper layer ordering
- Perform complex annotation workflows with mixed tool usage

**Edge Case Testing**
- Annotation on very small images (< 100px)
- Annotation on very large images (> 4K resolution)
- Maximum annotation count per image (100+ annotations)
- Rapid tool switching and drawing operations
- Memory pressure scenarios with large annotation histories

### Mocking Requirements

**Image Data Mocking**
