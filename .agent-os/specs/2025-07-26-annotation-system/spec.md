# Spec Requirements Document

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive annotation system for screenit that provides professional-grade drawing tools with SwiftUI Canvas integration, enabling users to annotate screenshots with arrows, text, rectangles, highlights, and blur effects while maintaining a complete undo/redo history.

## User Stories

### Professional Documentation Workflow

As a software developer, I want to annotate screenshots with arrows and text labels, so that I can create clear documentation and bug reports with precise visual callouts.

**Detailed Workflow:** User captures a screenshot using existing capture engine, then immediately enters annotation mode where they can select arrow tool, click to place arrow start point, drag to endpoint, then add text annotations with customizable colors and thickness. The annotated image can be saved or copied to clipboard with all annotations rendered into the final image.

### Design Review and Feedback

As a UI/UX designer, I want to highlight specific areas and add text comments on interface screenshots, so that I can provide clear feedback to developers and stakeholders during design reviews.

**Detailed Workflow:** User captures interface screenshot, uses rectangle tool to outline UI elements, applies highlight effect to draw attention to specific areas, adds text annotations with font size control, and uses blur tool to hide sensitive information before sharing with external stakeholders.

### Privacy Protection

As a professional sharing screenshots, I want to blur sensitive information like user data or credentials, so that I can share screenshots publicly without compromising privacy or security.

**Detailed Workflow:** User captures screenshot containing sensitive data, selects blur tool from annotation toolbar, draws over areas containing personal information, names, or credentials to apply gaussian blur effect, then exports the privacy-protected image for public sharing.

## Spec Scope

1. **SwiftUI Canvas Integration** - Canvas-based drawing surface that overlays captured images with real-time annotation rendering
2. **Arrow Annotation Tool** - Interactive arrow drawing with configurable color, thickness, and arrowhead styles  
3. **Text Annotation Tool** - Click-to-place text labels with font size, color, and background customization options
4. **Rectangle Annotation Tool** - Outline rectangles with stroke color, thickness, and optional fill transparency
5. **Highlight/Blur Effects** - Area selection tools for applying highlight overlays and privacy blur effects
6. **Annotation Toolbar** - Tool selection interface with keyboard shortcuts and visual state indicators
7. **Undo/Redo System** - Complete annotation history management with unlimited undo levels

## Out of Scope

- Advanced shape tools (circles, polygons, freehand drawing)
- Image editing features (crop, resize, filters)  
- Collaborative annotation or real-time sharing
- Animation or transition effects for annotations
- OCR or text extraction from captured images
- Integration with cloud storage or external services

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Annotation Interface** - Users can capture screenshots and immediately enter annotation mode with working tool selection
2. **Complete Tool Set** - All five annotation tools (arrow, text, rectangle, highlight, blur) are functional with configurable properties
3. **Persistent Annotation History** - Unlimited undo/redo functionality with complete state management throughout annotation session
