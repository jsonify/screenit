## Overview

Implement a Core Data-backed capture history system that allows users to browse, manage, and export their screenshot captures with persistent storage and metadata tracking.

## User Stories

### Screenshot History Management

As a professional developer, I want to access my recent screenshot history through a thumbnail grid interface, so that I can quickly find and reuse captures from previous work sessions.

**Detailed Workflow:** User opens the history view from the menu bar and sees a grid of thumbnail images representing their recent captures. Each thumbnail shows a preview of the capture with timestamp and basic metadata. The user can click on any thumbnail to view the full-size image with annotations, copy it to clipboard, delete it, or export it to a custom location.

### Persistent Annotation Storage

As a design professional, I want my annotations to be permanently saved with each capture, so that I can return to annotated screenshots later and make additional edits or export them for presentations.

**Detailed Workflow:** When a user creates annotations on a screenshot, the annotation data (tool types, positions, colors, text content) is saved to Core Data along with the image. Later, when viewing the capture from history, the user can see all annotations rendered correctly and optionally make additional changes before exporting.

### Efficient History Management

As a power user, I want the system to automatically manage storage limits and provide options to export or delete old captures, so that my disk space is efficiently managed while preserving important screenshots.

**Detailed Workflow:** The system tracks capture history with configurable limits (default 10 items). When the limit is reached, older captures are automatically removed unless marked as favorites. Users can manually delete unwanted captures or export them to custom locations before removal.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Data Stack Setup** - Complete database schema with CaptureItem and AnnotationData models
2. **History Storage System** - Automatic saving of captures with metadata and thumbnail generation
3. **History Grid Interface** - SwiftUI grid view displaying capture thumbnails with metadata overlay
4. **Clipboard Operations** - Quick copy functionality for historical captures
5. **Delete Management** - Safe deletion with confirmation dialogs and undo capability

## Out of Scope

- Advanced search and filtering capabilities (will be added in future phases)
- Bulk export operations (single item export only)
- Cloud synchronization or sharing features
- Image editing capabilities beyond existing annotations

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional History System** - Users can capture screenshots and view them in a persistent history grid
2. **Complete CRUD Operations** - Create, read, update, and delete operations work reliably with Core Data
3. **Export Functionality** - Users can copy to clipboard or save captures to custom locations from history
