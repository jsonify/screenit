## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**DataManager**
- Test Core Data stack initialization and configuration
- Test save operations with background context
- Test fetch operations with proper sorting and limits

- Test export with annotation rendering
- Test error handling for disk space and permission issues

### UI Tests

**History Grid Navigation**
- Test grid view displays thumbnails correctly
- Test thumbnail tap navigation to full-screen view
- Test context menu appearance and functionality
- Test empty state display when no captures exist
- Test loading states during data fetch operations

**Data Management UI**
- Test delete confirmation dialogs
- Test bulk selection and operations

### Mocking Requirements

**Core Data Testing**
- **NSPersistentContainer:** In-memory store for unit tests
- **Background Context:** Mock context for save operation testing
- **NSFetchedResultsController:** Mock delegate for change tracking tests

**File System Operations**
- **NSImage Processing:** Mock image resize and compression operations
- **Export Operations:** Mock file system writes and directory access
- **Clipboard Operations:** Mock NSPasteboard for copy functionality

**SwiftUI Preview Mocking**
- **Sample Data:** Generate mock CaptureItem objects with realistic data
- **Annotation Samples:** Create representative annotation data for UI testing
- **Error States:** Mock error conditions for UI error handling testing

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing
- Test grid performance with 100+ capture items
- Test memory usage during thumbnail generation
- Test background save operations under load
- Test UI responsiveness during data operations

### Storage Testing
- Test database size growth with retention limits
- Test cleanup operations and storage reclamation
- Test external binary storage performance
- Test concurrent read/write operations

## Quality Assurance

### Data Integrity Tests
- Verify annotation data persists correctly with captures
