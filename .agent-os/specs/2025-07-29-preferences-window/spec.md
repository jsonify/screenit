## Overview

Implement a comprehensive SwiftUI-based preferences window that provides user customization for all screenit settings. This feature enables users to configure hotkeys, save locations, annotation defaults, history settings, and system integration options through a modern macOS preferences interface.

## User Stories

### Power User Customization

As a power user, I want to customize keyboard shortcuts and save locations, so that screenit integrates seamlessly with my existing workflow and file organization system.

The user can access preferences through the menu bar, configure global hotkeys to avoid conflicts with other applications, set default save locations for different capture types, and adjust history retention limits based on their storage preferences.

### Professional Workflow Integration

As a design professional, I want to set annotation defaults and system integration options, so that my screenshot workflow is consistent and efficient for creating documentation and presentations.

The user can set default colors and thickness for annotation tools, enable launch at login for immediate availability, configure menu bar visibility preferences, and establish consistent annotation styles that match their professional brand guidelines.

## Spec Scope

1. **SwiftUI Preferences Window** - Modern tabbed interface following macOS Human Interface Guidelines
2. **Hotkey Customization Panel** - Visual hotkey recorder with conflict detection and validation
3. **File Management Settings** - Default save location picker with quick access folder shortcuts
4. **Annotation Defaults Configuration** - Color palette and tool thickness presets with live preview
5. **History Management Controls** - Retention limits and storage management with disk usage display
6. **System Integration Options** - Launch at login and menu bar visibility toggles

## Out of Scope

- Advanced plugin or extension configuration (reserved for future phases)
- Cloud sync or backup settings (not part of current architecture)
- Export format preferences (beyond basic save location selection)
- Accessibility settings beyond standard macOS support

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can open a preferences window from the menu bar that loads instantly and follows macOS design patterns
2. All preference changes are saved immediately with Core Data persistence and applied without requiring app restart
3. Hotkey customization prevents conflicts and provides clear feedback for invalid combinations or system-reserved shortcuts
