## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**CaptureEngine**
- Test authorization status checking and updates
- Test error handling for all CaptureError types
- Test singleton instance behavior and thread safety
- Test capture performance monitoring and metrics
- Test integration with ScreenCapturePermissionManager

**SCCaptureManager**
- Test shareable content discovery and refresh
- Test display bounds calculation for different screen configurations
- Test capture configuration validation and optimization
- Test error propagation from ScreenCaptureKit failures
- Test memory management during image capture operations

**CapturePerformanceTimer (New)**
- Test timing accuracy for capture operations
- Test metrics collection and reporting
- Test memory usage tracking during operations

**CaptureErrorHandler (New)**
- Test error message generation for all error types
- Test user-friendly message formatting
- Test error categorization and severity levels

**CaptureConfigurationManager (New)**
- Test optimal configuration selection for different scenarios
- Test display-specific settings optimization
- Test memory and performance configuration balancing

### Integration Tests

**Full Capture Workflow**
- Test complete capture flow from menu trigger to file save
- Test permission checking integration before capture attempts
- Test error propagation through the entire capture pipeline
- Test menu bar status updates during capture operations

**Permission Integration**
- Test capture behavior when permissions are granted, denied, or restricted
- Test permission request flow integration with capture attempts
- Test permission status monitoring and UI updates

**File System Integration**
- Test image saving to Desktop with proper filename generation
- Test error handling for file system permission issues
- Test image format and quality validation after save

### Mocking Requirements

- **ScreenCaptureKit Mock**: Mock SCShareableContent and SCScreenshotManager for testing without actual screen access
- **File System Mock**: Mock FileManager operations for testing save functionality without creating files
- **Permission Manager Mock**: Mock permission states to test all authorization scenarios
- **Performance Timer Mock**: Mock timing operations for consistent test execution
