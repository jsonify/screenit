# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: ScreenCaptureKit Integration Enhancement
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Enhance the existing ScreenCaptureKit integration to provide robust, production-ready screen capture functionality with comprehensive error handling, optimal performance configuration, and seamless integration with the menu bar application.

## User Stories

### Professional Developer Screenshot Workflow

As a professional developer, I want reliable screen capture functionality that works consistently across different macOS configurations, so that I can document bugs, create tutorials, and share design reviews without worrying about capture failures.

**Detailed Workflow**: User clicks "Capture Area" from menu bar → System checks permissions → Captures screen using optimized ScreenCaptureKit settings → Image is immediately saved to Desktop with timestamp → User receives confirmation of successful capture or clear error message if something fails.

### System Administrator Quality Assurance

As a system administrator, I want detailed error reporting and logging for screen capture operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and ensure reliable functionality across different macOS versions and configurations.

**Detailed Workflow**: Screen capture attempt triggers comprehensive logging → Permission status is validated and logged → Capture operation results are logged with performance metrics → Any errors include specific troubleshooting guidance → System provides actionable feedback for permission or configuration issues.

## Spec Scope

1. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Comprehensive error recovery with user-friendly messages and logging for troubleshooting
2. **Performance Optimization** - Optimal ScreenCaptureKit configuration for speed and image quality with memory management
3. **Permission Management Integration** - Seamless integration with existing permission system with proactive status checking
4. **Capture Quality Configuration** - High-quality image output with proper color space and pixel format settings
5. **Menu Bar Integration Enhancement** - Improved status feedback and error reporting through the existing menu bar interface

## Out of Scope

- Area selection UI (scheduled for Phase 2)
- Annotation tools (scheduled for Phase 3)
- Capture history persistence (scheduled for Phase 4)
- Global hotkey system beyond menu shortcuts (scheduled for Phase 5)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Reliable Full-Screen Capture** - User can consistently capture full screen with one click from menu bar
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling** - All failure modes provide clear user feedback with actionable guidance
3. **Performance Optimization** - Screen captures complete within 2 seconds with minimal memory footprint
