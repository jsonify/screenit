# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Basic SwiftUI Menu Bar Application
> Created: 2025-07-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Create the foundational SwiftUI menu bar application that will serve as the entry point for all screenit functionality. This establishes the core application architecture with a persistent menu bar presence, status item management, and basic menu interface that will be expanded with capture functionality in subsequent phases.

## User Stories

### Primary Menu Bar Integration

As a macOS user, I want to have screenit available in my menu bar at all times, so that I can quickly access screenshot functionality without launching a full application window.

This story covers the fundamental macOS integration pattern where users expect screenshot tools to be accessible via the menu bar. The application should launch silently, place an icon in the menu bar, and provide immediate access to functionality through a dropdown menu interface.

### Application Lifecycle Management

As a user, I want the screenit application to start quickly and run efficiently in the background, so that it doesn't impact my system performance while remaining instantly available for screen capture tasks.

This story addresses the need for proper macOS application lifecycle management including launch behavior, memory efficiency, and graceful shutdown procedures that are essential for a menu bar utility application.

## Spec Scope

1. **SwiftUI Menu Bar Architecture** - Complete menu bar application setup with SwiftUI integration
2. **NSStatusItem Management** - Status bar icon creation, positioning, and event handling
3. **Basic Menu Interface** - Dropdown menu with placeholder options for future functionality
4. **Application Lifecycle** - Proper app startup, background operation, and termination handling
5. **Foundation Components** - Core architectural components that will support future capture features

## Out of Scope

- Screenshot capture functionality (Phase 2)
- Global hotkey registration (Phase 2) 
- Preferences interface (Phase 5)
- Advanced menu customization beyond basic structure

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Menu Bar Application** - screenit appears in menu bar with clickable status item
2. **Basic Menu Structure** - Dropdown menu displays with placeholder items and Quit option
3. **Clean Application Lifecycle** - App launches properly and terminates cleanly without memory leaks
