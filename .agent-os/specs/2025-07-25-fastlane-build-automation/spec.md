> Spec: Fastlane Build Automation System
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive Fastlane build automation for screenit, providing automated debug/release builds, development workflows, beta/production release management, version synchronization with GitHub releases, and build verification utilities modeled after the sophisticated ClickIt Fastlane configuration.

## User Stories

### Developer Build Automation

As a screenit developer, I want automated build lanes with proper code signing, so that I can quickly build debug and release versions without manual Xcode configuration.

**Workflow:** Developer runs `fastlane build_debug` or `fastlane build_release` → Fastlane executes build script → Applies adhoc signature if needed → Provides feedback on build status and app location.

### Development Workflow Integration

As a screenit developer, I want a complete development workflow that builds and launches the app, so that I can test changes immediately with a single command.

**Workflow:** Developer runs `fastlane dev` → Validates version sync with GitHub → Builds debug version → Launches app → Provides development session feedback.

### Release Management Automation

As a screenit maintainer, I want automated beta and production release workflows with GitHub integration, so that I can create releases with proper tagging and artifact generation.

**Workflow:** Maintainer runs `fastlane beta` or `fastlane prod` → Validates branch and git status → Creates appropriate tags → Builds release version → Publishes GitHub release with artifacts.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Build Lanes** - Debug and release build automation with intelligent code signing fallbacks
2. **Development Workflow** - Integrated build-and-launch sequence with version validation
3. **Release Automation** - Beta and production release workflows with GitHub integration
4. **Build Verification** - Code signing verification and app bundle information utilities
5. **Version Management** - GitHub release synchronization with automated version bumping
6. **Clean Operations** - Build artifact cleanup and derived data management
7. **Automated Tagging** - Timestamp-based beta tags and semantic versioning for production

## Out of Scope

- App Store Connect integration (screenit is open source, not distributed via App Store)
- Notarization workflows (can be added later as enhancement)
- DMG packaging automation (separate future feature)
- CI/CD integration beyond GitHub releases

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Complete Fastlane Configuration** - Fastfile with all build and release lanes operational
2. **Build Script Integration** - Proper integration with existing Xcode build system
3. **GitHub CLI Integration** - Version synchronization and release management working
4. **Development Workflow** - Single-command development setup that builds and launches screenit
5. **Release Validation** - All release workflows tested with proper branch validation and error handling
