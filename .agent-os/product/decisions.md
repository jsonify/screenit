## 2025-01-27: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

screenit will be an open source CleanShot X alternative for macOS 15+ focusing on pixel-perfect screen capture with professional annotation tools, persistent capture history, and seamless menu bar integration.

### Context

CleanShot X provides excellent screenshot functionality but is expensive ($29+), closed source, and lacks customization options. The macOS built-in screenshot tools are insufficient for professional use cases. There's a clear market opportunity for a high-quality, open source alternative that serves developers, designers, and power users who need advanced screenshot capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Cross-Platform Electron App**
   - Pros: Wider user base, familiar web technologies, easier distribution
   - Cons: Poor performance, large memory footprint, non-native UI, doesn't leverage macOS-specific APIs

2. **Command-Line Tool Only**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, developer-focused, easy automation
   - Cons: Limited user base, no visual annotation tools, poor user experience for non-technical users

3. **Extend Existing Open Source Tools**
   - Pros: Faster initial development, existing user base, proven concepts
   - Cons: Technical debt, compromised architecture, limited control over direction

### Rationale

We chose a native macOS SwiftUI application because:
- **Performance:** ScreenCaptureKit and SwiftUI provide optimal performance and system integration
- **User Experience:** Native UI feels familiar to macOS users and follows platform conventions
- **Technical Advantage:** Access to latest macOS APIs and system-level functionality
- **Open Source Strategy:** Full source code availability with MIT license appeals to developer community
- **Market Positioning:** Direct competition with CleanShot X while being free and customizable

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Excellent performance using native macOS frameworks
- Professional-grade annotation tools with SwiftUI Canvas
- Strong appeal to developer and power user communities
- Full customization and extensibility through open source model
- Efficient development using familiar Apple technologies

**Negative:**
- Limited to macOS users only (no Windows/Linux support)
- Requires learning ScreenCaptureKit and SwiftUI Canvas APIs
- Dependency on Apple's framework evolution and compatibility
- Need to handle macOS permission and security model complexity

## 2025-01-27: SwiftUI + ScreenCaptureKit Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Use SwiftUI for all UI components with ScreenCaptureKit for screen capture, SwiftUI Canvas for annotations, and Core Data for persistence.

### Context

Need to choose core technologies that provide the best balance of performance, developer experience, and maintenance overhead while delivering pixel-perfect screen capture capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **AppKit + Objective-C**
   - Pros: Maximum control, proven performance, extensive documentation
   - Cons: Older APIs, more complex development, harder to maintain

2. **Mixed SwiftUI/AppKit Architecture**
   - Pros: Leverage best of both frameworks, gradual migration path
   - Cons: Complex bridging, inconsistent UI patterns, maintenance overhead

### Rationale

SwiftUI + ScreenCaptureKit provides:
- **Modern Development:** Declarative UI with excellent developer experience
- **Performance:** ScreenCaptureKit is optimized for macOS 12.3+ with excellent performance
- **Maintenance:** Single framework approach reduces complexity and maintenance burden
- **Future-Proof:** Apple's recommended path for new macOS applications

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster development with declarative UI patterns
- Consistent modern UI that follows macOS design guidelines
- Excellent integration with system APIs and permission models
- Future compatibility with Apple's technology roadmap

**Negative:**
- Minimum macOS version requirement (15.0+ for optimal SwiftUI features)
- Learning curve for SwiftUI Canvas annotation system
- Potential limitations in low-level screen capture customization

## 2025-01-27: Minimal Dependencies Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Security Lead

### Decision

Minimize external dependencies and use only Apple's native frameworks and Swift Package Manager for any essential third-party libraries.

### Context

Open source projects benefit from minimal dependencies to reduce security risks, maintenance overhead, and compilation complexity. Native frameworks provide better performance and system integration.

### Rationale

- **Security:** Fewer dependencies reduce attack surface and security audit requirements
- **Performance:** Native frameworks are optimized for macOS and provide better performance
- **Maintenance:** Fewer dependencies mean less maintenance overhead and version conflicts
- **Distribution:** Simpler build process and smaller application bundle

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enhanced security posture with minimal external code
- Better performance using optimized system frameworks
- Simpler build and distribution process
- Reduced maintenance and compatibility issues

**Negative:**
- May need to implement some functionality from scratch
- Limited access to specialized libraries and tools
- Potential for reinventing well-solved problems
